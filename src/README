Learn Kotlin by Examples

1. Each exercise are tiny and you should be able to complete one exercise in few minutes. Some of the exercises would
only take less than a minute
2. Walk through the code. It is important that you read the comments. Try to alter the program logic for your own
understanding
3. The exercises are written while learning Kotlin. So, the exercises might be very primitive. It is written keeping
the newbies in mind.
4. If you have some programs to contribute, write it and raise a pull request.
5. The exercises are written with the help of IntelliJ Community edition (so, it was easy to write)
6. Each exercise is independent unit and I did not use any build tools (neither planning to use one). I would like
to keep it KISS - Keep It Simple and Stupid
7. This README is written as and when I get a thought. So it might not be coherent
